What requirements did you achieve?
i managaged to achieve all of the basic requirements and out of the stretch-goals i implemented local storage to save and retrieve game data, also used for game Statistics. i believe i did a good job for styling, though there was more i wanted to do with it, such as changing the clickable cat. i didn't use the API as the only data from it that would be useful would be the increase, therfore it is a lot simpler and easier to write my own list for upgrades. 

What i couldn't achieve.
i left it till last minute to attempt but i haven't been able to achieve the sound effect on the clickable cat. i did what i thought i needed to do bbut didn't hear the sound and so i did some research and gave it one more attempt and still nothing. in the morning i will take another look at it.

this week i haven't had much free time to work on my assignment. therefore i primarily focused on achieving what i did in week 3 but in react. there are a few extras i added in such as, disabling the buttons till they are affordable and adding a background to make it more visually pleasing. i did want to change the clickable cat button to a cat cutout to overlay on top of the background image, to make it blend in more and look whole. Unfortunately i ran out of time. i also wanted to add an extra table of upgrades that double the efficiency of the recruited cats, this would need a lot more logic to figure out, which i haven't had the time to do but will be something i would like to attempt in the future.
